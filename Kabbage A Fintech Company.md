* The cash flow analytics are amazingly simple to read, and the transparency of the platform makes it appealing to consumers.

* Since American Express has merged with Kabbage and providing many solutions for small businesses they also offer the business account through a Kabbage debit card that can be tracked on your smart phone the IP is built just for the individual business.

It is trustworthy, transparent, easily accessible and without bias.
